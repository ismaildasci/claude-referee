# claude-referee

*Evidence over eloquence.* An unofficial CLI that hands small, checkable judgements to [TypeSafe Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai) and keeps local receipts. It is the same CLI that the claude-referee Claude Code plugin bundles.

```bash
npm test 2>&1 | npx claude-referee done --criteria "all tests pass" --evidence -
npx claude-referee decide < decision.json
npx claude-referee doctor
```

Every command prints one JSON line and accepts `--describe`, which prints its contract. `--dry-run` shows the redacted request without sending it.

You need Node 20.3 or later and a TypeSafe API key in `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, `TYPESAFE_API_KEY_CMD` or, on macOS, the Keychain item `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`.
